AMPS is amount of electricity.
VOLTS is the Push, not the amount(Pressure).
OHMS slows the flow.
WATTS is how much gets done.


Water = Charge (measured in Coulombs)
Pressure = Voltage (measured in Volts)
Flow = Current (measured in Amperes, or “Amps” for short)



v=I*R

Where

    V = Voltage in volts
    I = Current in amps
    R = Resistance in ohms



Ohm's Law: 
    R = Resistance (ohms)
    E = Electro-motive Force (volts)
    I = Intensity of Current (amps) 

I*R = E

 express work done: Power formula (PIE Law):

Where:
    P = Power (watts) 
    I = Intensity of Current (amps) 
    V = Electro-motive Force (volts)

P = IV
I=Q/T=dQ/dt
	 

	  P = V * I                     Power = Voltage  * Current

            P = V2 / R                  Power = Voltage2 / Resistance           

            P = I2 * R                     Power = Current2 * Resistance
	  E = V * I * t                Energy = Voltage  * Current  * time

            E = P * t                      Energy = Power  * time


T.R=NP/NS=VP/VS= n(Turns Ration)==>QP=QS=>N1/N2=V1/V2=I2/I1
E=Turns X Rate of Chage
E=N*dQ/dt
VP*IP=VS*IS
